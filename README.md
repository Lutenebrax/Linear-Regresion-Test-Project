# Machine Learning - Linear Regresion Test Project


For this project we will use the Housing Data for the city of Ames, Iowa in United States from 2006 to 2010. 
The intention is to use the relevant columns do create a linear regresion model that let us predict the values for the Sales Price.
We will make some validations to get the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and use it to have an idea of how good or bad is the model we made.

Information about the dataset can be found in the following link.
